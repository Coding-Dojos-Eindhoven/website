We know object-oriented programming, imperative programming, we have even done functional programming, but there is also “logic programming”. Intuitively this means that you specify a set of criteria that the solution has to satisfy, and then let the computer come up with the solution(s). In this coding dojo we will dip our toes into logic programming. A well-known language for that is Prolog, but we will use Clojure for this. Don’t worry if you don’t know anything about Clojure, we’ll start from the beginning.

So in short:

* October 24, 17.00 – 21.00, HTC 33
* Dinner included
* Fun
* Puzzling
* Logic - Prolog + Clojure
* Let us know if:
    * You don’t already have access to HTC33
    * You have special dietary preferences
* Please forward to anybody who may be interested!

If you come, please prepare by installing the development environment:

* Make sure you have Java JDK 11 or above
    * Mac: `brew cask install adoptopenjdk`
    * Windows: Download from
      [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
      and install
    * Linux: I don't really know, but since you're a Linux user I'm going to
    assume you do. :)
* Download the latest Nightcode JAR (version 2.8.1 at this time) from
  [the releases page](https://github.com/oakes/Nightcode/releases). Nightcode is a small Clojure IDE
  that has all other required dependencies. If your Java environment is
  installed properly, you should be able to double-click the JAR to start
  Nightcode (on macOS you may have to right-click and select “Open” from the
  context menu, depending on your security settings).
